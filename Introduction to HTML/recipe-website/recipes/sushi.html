      Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This
      is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to
      learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi
      (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!

        Soak and cook the rice, then mix in the vinegar and cool in an even
        layer on a plate.

        Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get an inexpensive one online) on
        a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally to you.
        Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a sheet
        (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.

          over the nori. (See below for more about making perfect sushi rice.)

        <p>
          Don't use too much rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for
          how much rice to use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per whole
          sheet of nori, leaving a small space at the top edge of the nori so
          you can seal up the roll.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>PRO TIP: </strong>Wet your fingers as you spread the sticky
          sushi rice over the nori.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't
        overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside,
        simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat.
        Then add your ingredients to the top of the nori.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi. Press and shape
        the ingredients into a tube. Roll with pressure so you get a firm roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top. Seal the edge of the
        nori with a little cold water. Firm it up by squeezing the mat around
        the roll until it feels uniformly snug. Be careful not to squeeze so
        hard that the ingredients are smashed or come oozing out the sides. It's
        a fine line; with practice you'll get the feel of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting board. Then
        cut each half into thirds -- so you have 6 pieces of sushi. To get a
        nice clean cut, wet the knife with water each time you make a slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates. Enjoy with soy
        sauce and wasabi paste
